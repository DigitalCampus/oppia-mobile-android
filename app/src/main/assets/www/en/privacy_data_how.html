<h2>How is your data used?</h2>
<p>Data is collected to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Provide a personalised experience in the app, monitor what percentage of course activities
		you have completed and passed; in order to award points and badges</li>
	<li>Determine the countries users are accessing from (using the IP address)</li>
	<li>Implementing organisations will often use anonymised or summary data to help analyse,
		monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the training courses provided. In this instance
		exactly how your data is used will depend on the implementing organisation.</li>
