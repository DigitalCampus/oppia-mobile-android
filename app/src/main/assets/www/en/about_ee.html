<h3>About Extension Essentials</h3>
<p>Extension Essentials is a mobile based learning app for Health Extension Workers (HEWs) developed
    using <a href="https://digital-campus.org/oppiamobile">OppiaMobile platform</a>. It is developed
    by the Ethiopian Ministry of Health in collaboration
    with Last Mile Health (LMH) as part of an in-service training program for HEWs, also known as
    Integrated Refresher Training (IRT)â€“ with the aim of enhancing the attitude, knowledge and
    skills of HEWs using digital learning tools. </p>

<p>The app covers all six units of the RMNCH module and makes learning easy and interactive through
    effective learning methods, continuous assessments and participatory activities. To support this,
    the app has incorporated pre and post knowledge assessments, case studies, quizzes, videos
    (animation and lecture) character stories, self-efficacy questions and more.
</p>

<p>
    The app interface is very easy to navigate and is user friendly. The score card feature of the
    app allows learners to see and track their score, activities and quiz performances. The app
    also has a points feature where learners can see their points earned, position/ rank and badge
    awards. Once downloaded onto the user's device, all the contents and activities of the module
    can be accessed offline by learners anytime and anywhere.
