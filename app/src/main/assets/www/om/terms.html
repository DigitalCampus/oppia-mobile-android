    13 WHOSE REGISTRATION HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY A LEGAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN.</p>
<p><strong>1.1 By using or registering</strong> an account for the Services, you are of legal age of
    consent to open an account under the laws of your country of residence, or (iii) your use of the 
    Services has been approved by your parent or legal guardian. You also represent that you have 
    not been previously suspended or removed from the Services by Digital Campus, and that your 
    registration and your use of the Services is in compliance with any and all applicable laws.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Account.</strong> In order to use certain features of the Services, you must register
    for an account. You may be asked to provide a password in connection with your account. You are 
    solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you 
    agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. 
    You agree that the information you provide to Digital Campus, whether at registration or at any 
    other time, will be true, accurate, current, and complete. You also agree that you will ensure 
    that this information is kept accurate and up-to-date at all times. If you have reason to 
    believe that your account is no longer secure (e.g., in the event of a loss, theft, or 
    unauthorized disclosure or use of your account ID or password), then you agree to immediately 
    notify Digital Campus at <a href="mailto:admin@digital-campus.org">admin@digital-campus.org</a>. 
    You may be liable for the losses incurred by Digital Campus or others due to any unauthorized 
    use of your Services account.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 International Use.</strong> Digital-Camus operates the Services in the European 
    Economic Area (EEA). If you choose to access our Services from locations outside the EEA, you 
    consent to the collection, transmission, use, storage and processing of content and data 
    (including your personal information) in the EEA. You also agree to comply with and are solely 
    responsible for ensuring compliance with all local laws, regulations, and rules in the 
    jurisdiction in which you reside or access the Services, if and to the extent local laws are 
    applicable to use of our Services. If you are under the age of 18, you confirm that you have 
    received parental consent, if required in your jurisdiction, to open an account for Service and 
    enter into these Terms. Unless we have entered into a separate, mutually executed written 
    agreement with you that says otherwise, we do not represent that our Services are appropriate or
    available for use in jurisdictions outside the EEA. The right to access and use the Services is 
    not granted in jurisdictions, if any, where it may be prohibited, or where your use would 
    render Digital Campus in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including without 
    limitation, Applicable Privacy Laws.</p>

    legal parent or guardian. If you are under the age of 18, you represent that your parent or 
    legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to the Terms on your behalf. Digital Campus understands 
    the importance of protecting children&rsquo;s privacy in the interactive online world. The 
    Services are not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children under 13 years of age. It 
    is not our policy to intentionally collect or maintain information about anyone under the age 
    of 13. No one under the age of 13 should submit any Personal Information to Digital Campus or 
    the Services.</p>
<p><strong>1.5 Parent User</strong>. If you are at least 18 years of age and you are the legal 
    parent or guardian of a child that seeks to register as a Child User of the Services, you may 
    register an account on the Services (&quot;Parent User&quot;). You may create, register, manage 
    and approve Child User accounts only for your own child(ren) or child(ren) for whom you are a 
    legal guardian. IF YOU REGISTER, APPROVE OR CONSENT TO THE REGISTRATION OF, OR OTHERWISE ASSUME 
    RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CHILD USER, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE SUCH CHILD USER&#39;S 
    LEGAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN AND YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS ON BEHALF OF SUCH CHILD USER, 
    INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION BEING LIABLE FOR ALL USE OF THE WEBSITE AND MOBILE PLATFORM BY THE 
    CHILD USER. You acknowledge that Digital Campus may choose, but is not obligated, to make any 
    inquiries, either directly or through third parties, that Digital Campus deems necessary to 
    validate your registration information, including without limitation engaging third parties to 
    provide verification services. Digital Campus reserves all rights to take legal actions against 
    anyone who misrepresents personal information or is otherwise untruthful about their identity. 
    NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT  DIGITAL CAMPUS CANNOT GUARANTEE THE 
    ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY ANY USER AND  DIGITAL CAMPUS IS NOT OBLIGATED TO 
    VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF ANY USER, INCLUDING ANY USER&#39;S CLAIM TO BE A PARENT USER, OR TO 
    VERIFY THAT A PARENT IDENTIFIED BY A CHILD USER OR OTHER PARTY DURING REGISTRATION IS SUCH 
    CHILD USER&#39;S ACTUAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN. A Parent User account, along with all associated 
    Child User accounts, may be terminated by Digital Campus at any time and without warning for any
    failure to abide by these Terms.</p>
<h2>2. Privacy Policy.</h2>
<p>Your privacy is important to Digital Campus. Please read the Digital Campus Privacy Policy, which
    is hereby incorporated into these Terms (and which are part of our contract with you),
    carefully for information relating to Digital Campus&rsquo; collection, use, and disclosure of
    your personal information. Among other things, our Privacy Policy explains how we treat your
    personal information and protect your privacy when you use our Services, and explains the
    procedures by which Users may view, update, correct, or delete their account and personal
    information.</p>

    media formats and through any media channels (now known or hereafter developed, to the extent

    perpetual and irrevocable, except to the extent required to comply with Applicable Privacy Law
    relating to ownership and control of your personal information, including education records.</p>
<p><strong>5.3 License Grant to Users.</strong></p>
<p>(a) User Content. By posting, submitting or distributing User Content through the Services, you
    hereby grant to each User of the Services a non-exclusive license to access and use your User
    Content in any manner permitted or made available by Digital Campus on or through the Services.
</p>
<p>(b) Downloadable Content. The Services may permit you to download certain digital educational
    content (&quot;Downloadable Content&quot;). Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with
    all the terms and conditions set forth herein, Digital Campus grants you, a limited,
    non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download, install,
    view and use the Downloadable Content, in object code form, on devices owned or controlled by
    you, solely for your personal, non-commercial purposes. You agree not to (i) modify or create

    limitations or security features in or protecting the Downloadable Content, and (iii) remove

    .</p>
<p><strong>5.4 Access to Your User Content.</strong> Digital Campus may permit Users to share
    their User Content with a select group of other Users, or make their User Content public for
    all (even non-Services users) to view. You acknowledge and agree that, although Digital Campus
    may provide certain features intended to allow you to restrict some User Content you create
    from others, Digital Campus does not guarantee that such User Content will never be accessible
    by others. In the event of unauthorized access, Digital Campus will use reasonable efforts to
    notify you pursuant to Section 15.1 below. Digital Campus HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL
    LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO ANY RESTRICTED USER CONTENT.</p>

    Content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and
    hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against Digital
    Campus with respect thereto. Digital Campus does not endorse any User Content or any opinion,
    recommendation or advice expressed therein, and Digital Campus expressly disclaims any and all
    liability in connection with User Content.</p>
<h2>6. Digital Millenium Copyright Act.</h2>
<p>It is Digital Campus&rsquo; policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that
    comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Digital Campus will promptly terminate
    without notice your access to the Services if you are determined by Digital Campus to be a
    &quot;repeat infringer.&quot; A repeat infringer is a User who has been notified by Digital
    Campus of infringing activity violations more than twice and/or who has had User Content or
    any other user-submitted content removed from the Services more than twice.</p>
<h2>7. Proprietary Materials; Licenses</h2>
<p><strong>7.1 Proprietary Materials.</strong> The Services are owned and operated by Digital
    Campus. The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, computer code
    (including source code or object code), software, services, content, educational videos and
    exercises, and all other elements of the Services (the &quot;Services &quot;) are protected
    by European and international copyright, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions,
    and other applicable laws governing intellectual property and proprietary rights. Except for
    any User Content provided and owned by Users and except as otherwise set forth in this
    Section 7, all Services Materials, and all trademarks, service marks, and trade names,
    contained on or available through the Services are owned by or licensed to Digital Campus,
    and Digital Campus reserves all rights therein and thereto not expressly granted by these
    Terms.</p>
<p><strong>7.2 Licensed Educational Content.</strong> Digital Campus may make available on the
    Services educational courses, videos, exercises, and related supplementary materials that are
    owned by Digital Campus or its third-party licensors (the &quot;Licensed Educational
    Content&quot;). Digital Campus grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access
    and use the Licensed Educational Content as made available on the Services by Digital Campus
    solely for your personal, non-commercial purposes. Unless expressly indicated on the Services
    that a particular item of Licensed Educational Content is made available to Users under
    alternate license terms, you may not download, distribute, sell, lease, modify, or otherwise
    provide access to the Licensed Educational Content to any third party.</p>
<p>(a) Alternate Licenses. In certain cases, Digital Campus or its licensors may make available
    Licensed Educational Content under alternate license terms, such as a variant of the Creative
    Commons License (as defined below) (each, an &quot;Alternate License&quot;).
        Where expressly indicated as such on the Services, and subject to the terms and conditions of
        these Terms, the applicable Licensed Educational Content is licensed to you under the terms
        of the Alternate License. By using, downloading, or otherwise accessing such Licensed
        Educational Content, you agree to comply fully with all the terms and conditions of such
        Alternate License.</p>
<p>(b) Creative Commons License. Unless expressly otherwise identified on the Online Services with
    respect to a particular item of Licensed Educational Content, any reference to the
    &quot;Creative Commons&quot;, &quot;CC&quot; or similarly-phrased license shall be deemed to
    be a reference to the Creative Commons Attribution - Non Commercial &ndash;ShareAlike3.0
    License (available at <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">
        creativecommons.org/licenses/</a>)(the&quot;CreativeCommonsLicense&quot;).</p>
<p><strong>7.3 Non-Commercial Use.</strong> The Licensed Educational Content and Licensed Platform 
    Code are intended for personal, non-commercial use only. Without limiting the foregoing, and 
    notwithstanding the terms of any Alternate License for such Licensed Educational Content, the 
    Licensed Educational Content may not be used, distributed or otherwise exploited for any 
    commercial purpose, commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, unless otherwise 
    previously agreed in writing by Digital Campus.</p>
<p>(a) Impermissible Uses. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following are 
    types of uses that Digital-campus expressly defines as falling outside of 
    &quot;non-commercial&quot; use:</p>
<p>i. the sale or rental of (1) any part of the Licensed Educational Content, (2) any derivative 
    works based at least in part on the Licensed Educational Content, or (3) any collective work 
    that includes any part of the Licensed Educational Content;</p>
<p>ii. providing training, support, or editorial services that use or reference the Licensed 
    Educational Content in exchange for a fee; and</p>
<p>iii. the sale of advertisements, sponsorships, or promotions placed on the Licensed 
    Educational Content, or any part thereof, or the sale of advertisements, sponsorships, or 
    promotions on any website or blog containing any part of the Licensed Educational Material, 
    including without limitation any &quot;pop-up advertisements&quot;.</p>
<p>(b) Use Characterization. Whether a particular use of the Licensed Educational Content is 
    &quot;non-commercial&quot; depends on the use, not the user. Thus, a use of the Licensed 
    Educational Content that does not require that users pay fees and that does not provide an 
    entity with a commercial advantage is &quot;non-commercial,&quot; even if this use is by a 
    commercial entity. Conversely, any use that involves charging users in connection with their 
    access to the Licensed Educational Content is not &quot;non-commercial,&quot; even if this use 
    is by a non-profit entity. As an example, a for-profit corporation&#39;s use of the Licensed 
    Educational Content for internal professional development or training of employees is permitted, 
    so long as the corporation charges no fees, directly or indirectly, for such use. Conversely, 
    as another example, a non-profit entity&#39;s use of the Licensed Educational Content in 
    connection with an fee-based training or educational program is NOT &quot;non-commercial&quot;
    and is not permitted.</p>
<p><strong>7.4 Crediting Digital Campus.</strong> If you distribute, publicly perform or display, 
    transmit, publish, or otherwise make available any Licensed Educational Content or any 
    derivative works thereof, you must also provide the following notice prominently along with 
    such Licensed Educational Content or derivative work thereof: &quot;All Digital Campus 
    content is available for free at 
    <a href="https://www.digital-campus.org">https://www.digital-campus.org</a>.</p>

    through Reference Sites. ACCESS AND USE OF REFERENCE SITES, INCLUDING THE INFORMATION,

    regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, postings on the Services, or other
    reasonable means. Notice will be deemed given twenty-four hours after email is sent, unless
    Digital Campus is notified that the email address is invalid. Alternatively, we may give you
    legal notice by mail to a postal address, if provided by you through the Services. In such
    case, notice will be deemed given three days after the date of mailing. Notices posted on the
    Services are deemed given 30 days following the initial posting. Any notices directed to
    Digital Campus shall be sent by Mail to Digital Campus at Digital Campus programme. University
    of Alcal&aacute; Foundation. 28801 Alcal&aacute; de Henares, Madrid, Spain and also via e-mail
    to <a href="mailto:admin@digital-campus.org">admin@digital-campus.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>15.2 Waiver.</strong> The failure of Digital Campus to exercise or enforce any right or
    provision of the Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of
    any provision of the Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by Digital Campus.</p>
<p><strong>15.3 Governing Law</strong>. The Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance
    with the laws of Spain, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law that would
    cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>15.4 Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.</strong> PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY
    BECAUSE IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. BY AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO
    LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE.</p>
<p><strong>(a) Generally.</strong> In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, Digital
    Campus and you agree that any legal or equitable claim, dispute, action or proceeding arising
    from or related to your use of the Services or these Terms (&quot;Dispute&quot;) will be
    resolved as follows to the fullest extent permitted by law:</p>
<p><strong>(b) Notice of Dispute.</strong> In the event of a Dispute, you or Digital Campus must
    give the other a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information
    of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and a proposed solution (a
    &quot;Notice of Dispute&quot;). You must send any Notice of Dispute by first class Mail to
    Digital Campus at Digital Campus programme. University of Alcal&aacute; Foundation. 28801
    Alcal&aacute; de Henares, Madrid, Spain and also via e-mail to
    <a href="mailto:admin@digital-campus.org">admin@digital-campus.org</a>. Digital Campus will
    send any Notice of Dispute to you by first class Mail to your address if Digital Campus has it,
    or otherwise to your e-mail address. You and Digital Campus will attempt in good faith to
    resolve any Dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the
    Notice of Dispute is sent. After sixty (60) days, you or Digital Campus may commence
    arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>(c) Binding Arbitration.</strong> Any Dispute which has not been resolved by negotiation
    as provided herein within sixty (60) days or such time period as you and Digital Campus may
    otherwise agree, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration as described in this Section
    15.4. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member)
    all Disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a
    neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal. The
    place of arbitration shall be Madrid, Spain. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may
    enforce the arbitrator&#39;s award.</p>
<p><strong>(d) Class Action Waiver.</strong> Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any Dispute in
    any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor Digital Campus will
    seek to have any Dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either
    party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will
    be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected
    arbitrations or proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>(e) Arbitration Procedures.</strong> Digital Campus and you agree to select a mutually
    agreeable alternative dispute resolution service and that such alternative dispute resolution
    service shall apply the JAMS Rules (https://www.jamsadr.com).The arbitrator may award the same
    damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or
    injunctive relief to you only individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your
    individual claim.</p>
<p><strong>(f) Arbitration Fees.</strong> Whoever files the arbitration will pay the initial filing
    fee. If Digital Campus files, Digital Campus will pay; if you file, then you will pay unless
    you get a fee waiver under the applicable arbitration rules. Each party will bear the expense
    of that party&#39;s attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which
    party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the
    arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.</p>
<p><strong>(g) Filing Period.</strong> To the extent permitted by law, any Dispute under these
    Terms must be filed within one (1) year in an arbitration proceeding. The one-year period
    begins when the events giving rise to the Dispute first occur. If a Dispute is not filed
    within one year, it is permanently barred.</p>
<p><strong>(h) Venue.</strong> In the event that any Dispute cannot be resolved by binding
    arbitration in accordance with this Section 15.4, you agree that such Dispute will be filed
    only in courts in and for Madrid, Spain and each of you and Digital Campus hereby consent and
    submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating
    any such action. Notwithstanding this, Digital Campus shall still be allowed to apply for
    injunctive or other equitable relief to protect or enforce its intellectual property rights in
    any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>15.5 Severability.</strong> If any provision of the Terms or any Guidelines is held to
    be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or
    eliminated from the Terms to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and
    enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
<p><strong>15.6 Assignment.</strong> The Terms and related Guidelines, and any rights and licenses
    granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without Digital Campus&rsquo;
    prior written consent, but may be assigned by Digital Campus without consent or any restriction.
    Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of the Terms shall be null and void.</p>
<p><strong>15.7 Survival.</strong> Upon termination of the Terms, any provision which, by its
    nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration, including,
    but not limited to, Sections 2, 4 through 6, 7.1, 7.4, 7.5, and 8 through 15.</p>
<p><strong>15.8 Headings.</strong> The heading references herein are for convenience purposes only,
    do not constitute a part of the Terms, and will not be deemed to limit or affect any of the
    provisions hereof.</p>
<p><strong>15.9 Entire Agreement.</strong> The Terms, the Privacy Policy and Guidelines constitute
    the entire agreement between you and Digital Campus relating to the subject matter herein and
    will not be modified except in writing, signed by both parties, or by a change to the Terms,
    Privacy Policy or Guidelines made by Digital Campus as set forth in Section 4 above.</p>
