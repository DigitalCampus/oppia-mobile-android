<a id="faq1"></a><h3>Installing new courses</h3>

This will give you a list of the courses to select to download. you will need an active internet
connection to get the list of courses and to install them.</p>

<a id="faq2"></a><h3>Updating courses</h3>
<p>OppiaMobile will automatically alert you when there are new updates to your courses available and 
ready to download. You can also manually check for updates by visiting the manage courses page.</p>
<a href="#top" class="btn gotop">Top</a>

<a id="faq3"></a><h3>Installing/downloading media and videos</h3>
<p>When you download a new course, the course download will not include any media or video files. 
    This is to ensure that the course is not too large to download easily, since the videos may be very large.
    Instead, the media/video files should either be downloaded or copied to your phone SD card separately.
    OppiaMobile will alert you if any required videos are missing, you can then select to download them.
    If you don't have a wifi connection, you can download the files directly to your PC,
    and then copy them to the SD card form there, alternatively you can use Bluetooth to copy media
    files from another users phone to yours.</p>

<a id="faq4"></a><h3>Playing media and videos</h3>
<p>When there are videos in your course, you only need to press to play on them. If you receive a
    message that the video could not be played, it is likely that you haven't yet downloaded that video.</p>

<a id="faq5"></a><h3>Points, Badges and Certificates - What are they?</h3>
<p>OppiaMobile has gamification built-in, so you will gain points, badges and certificates as you
    progress through the course content.</p>
<h4>Points</h4>
<p>Points are given when you interact with the course content, for example, reading a page,
    attempting a quiz or watching a video. You will gain more points if you regularly you look at
    the course content.</p>
<h4>Badges</h4>
<p>Badges are given when you complete a course, which means you have passed all the quizzes in the
    course and completed at least 80% of the other activities.</p>

<h4>Certificates</h4>
<p>Some courses also give you certificates when you complete them. You can download these
    certificates in pdf format from the app, for printing or showing to your supervisor.</p>
