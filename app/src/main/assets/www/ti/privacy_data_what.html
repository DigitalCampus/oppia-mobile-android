<h2>What data is collected?</h2>

		information will depend on the implementation</li>
	<li>which courses you have downloaded, when you access any course activity, how long you spend
		in each activity, including your quiz scores, feedback responses, and media watched</li>
	<li>your IP address is associated with each activity you take in the courses</li>
	<li>your network connectivity status</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, if there is a problem with the Oppia app, we use an automated bug reporting system,
