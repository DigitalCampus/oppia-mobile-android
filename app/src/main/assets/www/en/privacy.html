	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

	<p>Effective Date: 23 March 2021</p>

	<p>Digital Campus, a mobile learning development programme based at the Fundacion General de la
		Universidad de Alcalá (FGUA) a public non-profit institution of the University of Alcalá
		(“Digital Campus,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting the privacy of users of
		the website located at www.digital-campus.org and of our mobile learning platform
		(“OppiaMobile”) (https://digital-campus.org/oppiamobile/) owned, developed, operated,
		licensed or controlled by us (the “Online Services”). This privacy policy (the “Privacy
		Policy”) describes how we gather and use information about visitors to and users of our
		Online Services (“Users”). This Privacy Policy applies solely to the information that we
		collect through the Online Services.</p>

	<h3>Acceptance of Privacy Policy</h3>

	<p>By using the Online Services, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do
		not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Online Services. Your
		continued use of the Online Services following the posting of changes to these terms will
		mean that you accept those changes.<p>

	<h3>How Do We Collect Your Information?</h3>

	<h4>Personal Information</h4>

	<p>You may use some of our Online Services without telling us anything about yourself. If you
		contact us, or register for an account via the Online Services, we may ask you to provide
		Personal Information (as defined below), such as your name, address, telephone number or
		e-mail address. We may also receive Personal Information about you from third parties, such
		as our business partners or vendors who we engage to help administer the Online Services.
		“Personal Information” for purposes of this Privacy Policy is any information relating to
		you as an identified or identifiable natural person. An “identifiable natural person” is one
		who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier
		such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or
		more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural
		or social identity of that natural person.</p>

	<p>From time to time, our Online Services may be configured to collect domain, usage, and Google
		Analytics information. This data enables us to become more familiar with which users use our
		services, how often they visit and what parts of the services they utilize most often.
		Digital Campus uses this information to improve our Online Services. No personally
		identifiable information is gathered in this process. This information is collected
		automatically and requires no action on your part.</p>

	<h4>Other Information</h4>

	<p>“Other Information” is any information that is not Personal Information, such as browser
		information, app usage data (including quiz attempts, scores and course completion),
		information collected through cookies and other technologies, demographic information, and
		aggregated information. We collect Other Information when you submit it to us. It may
		include your zip code, education, occupation, and interests.</p>

	<p>We may also receive Other Information about you from third-parties, including, for example,
		demographic data, information about your interests, and information about your activities
		through the Online Services. Each time a User utilizes the Online Services, Digital Campus
		collects some information to improve the overall quality of the User’s online experience.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Aggregated Data: Digital Campus collects aggregate queries for internal reporting and
			also counts, tracks, and aggregates the User’s activity (including quiz attempts, scores
			and course completion) into Digital Campus’ analysis of general traffic flow to the
			Online Services and Users’ utilization of and performance within the Online Services.
			To these ends, Digital Campus may merge information about you into aggregated group
			data. In some cases, Digital Campus may remove personal identifiers from Personal
			Information and maintain it in aggregate form that may later be combined with other
			information to generate anonymous, aggregated statistical information. Such anonymous,
			group data may be shared on an aggregated basis with Digital Campus’ partners, service
			providers and/or vendors; if it does so, Digital Campus will not disclose your
			individual identity.</li>
		<li>Web Server Logs and IP Addresses: An Internet Protocol (“IP”) address is a number that
			automatically identifies the computer or device you have used to access the Internet.
			The IP address enables our server to send you the web pages that you want to visit, and
			it may disclose the server owned by your Internet Service Provider. Digital Campus may
			use IP addresses to conduct analyses and performance reviews and to administer the
			Online Services.</li>
		<li>Cookies and Web Beacons: Periodically, some pages or screens on the Online Services may
			use “cookies,” which are small files that the site places on your hard drive for
			identification purposes. These files are used for site registration and customization
			the next time you visit us. You should note that cookies can not read data off of your
			hard drive. Your web browser may allow you to be notified when you are receiving a
			cookie, giving you the choice to accept it or not. You can also refuse all cookies by
			turning them off in your browser. By not accepting cookies, some pages may not fully
			function and you may not be able to access certain information on the Online Services.
			Information that we collect through cookies includes (i) the name and version of the
			operating system on the User’s computer or mobile device, (ii) the name and version of
			the User’s browser, (iii) which aspects or pages of the Online Services the User is
			currently reading, as well as clicks and time spent on a particular page or screen,
			(iv) if the User was sent to the current page by some other page on the web, the
			universal resource locator (“URL”) of the referring web page, and (v) geolocation of
			the User’s computer or device. Some of the Site’s web pages may use web beacons in
			conjunction with cookies to compile aggregate statistics about Site usage. A web
			beacon is an electronic image (also referred to as an “action tag,” “single-pixel,”
			or “clear GIF”) that is commonly used to track the traffic patterns of users from one
			web page to another in order to maximize web traffic flow and to otherwise analyze the
			effectiveness of the User. Some web beacons may be unusable if you elect to reject their
			associated cookies.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>By accessing and using the Online Services, you expressly consent to the storage of cookies,
		other local storage technologies, beacons or other information on your computer or devices.
		You also consent to the access of such cookies, local storage technologies, beacons and
		information by us.</p>

	<h3>Sensitive Personal Information</h3>

	<p>Unless specifically requested (for example, in connection with a particular survey), we ask
		that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal information (e.g.
		information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other
		beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union
		membership) on or through the Services or otherwise to us. Any requested information that
		includes sensitive information about health, political opinions, ethnicity, race, religion,
		sex life or sexual orientation can be left unanswered.</p>

	<h3>How Do We Use Your Information?</h3>

	<p>If you choose to provide us with Personal Information by completing a form through the Online
		Services, including, if applicable, account registration, or emailing us, we will use that
		Personal Information to (i) respond to your question or request, (ii) communicate with you
		about our organization via email, (iii) send information to you, and (iv) notify you of
		changes to this Privacy Policy. If you do not wish to receive unsolicited emails or other
		communications from us, you may contact us at
		<a href="mailto:admin@digital-campus.org">admin@digital-campus.org</a> and request that your
		Personal Information be removed from our list.</p>
	<p>We will only use your Personal Information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will
		use your Personal Information in the following circumstances:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Where you have requested information from Digital Campus about its services.</li>
		<li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into
			with you.</li>
		<li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your
			interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. “Legitimate interest”
			is a technical term under applicable regulations. It means that there are good reasons
			for the processing of your personal information and measures are taken to minimize the
			impact on your privacy rights and interests. “Legitimate interest” also references our
			use of your data in ways you would reasonably expect and that have a minimal privacy
			impact. We have a legitimate interest in collecting and processing personal information,
			for example: (1) to ensure that our networks and information are secure; (2) to
			administer and generally conduct business within Digital Campus; and (3) to prevent
			fraud.</li>
		<li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Note that we may process your Personal Information for more than one lawful ground depending
		on the specific purpose for which we are using your data. Please note that we may use and
		disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise
		under applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information
		under applicable law, then we may use and disclose it for all the purposes for which we use
		and disclose Personal Information. We may combine Other Information with your Personal
		Information, and when we do, we treat the combined information as Personal Information.</p>

	<h3>Do We Disclose Any Personal Information to Outside Parties?</h3>

	<p>Unless you expressly give us permission in writing to do so, Digital Campus will not sell,
		rent, license, or trade your Personal Information other than as specified in this Privacy
		Policy.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Information that they have provided to Digital Campus through the Online Disclosures to
			Third Parties Assisting In Our Operations: Digital Campus may share your Personal
			Information under confidentiality agreements with other companies that work with, or on
			behalf of, Digital Campus to provide services. These companies may use your Personal
			Information to assist Digital Campus in its operations and impact. However, these
			companies do not have any independent right to share this information.</li>
		<li>Disclosures Under Special Circumstances: We may provide information about you to respond
			to subpoenas, court orders, legal process or governmental regulations, or to establish
			or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We believe it is necessary
			to share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal
			activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical
			safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law. In such circumstances, we will
			take appropriate measures to ensure that the requester understands the sensitive nature
			of the Personal Information that they may receive.</li>
		<li>Business Transfers: We may share your Personal Information with other business entities
			in connection with the sale, assignment, merger or other transfer of all or a portion of
			Digital Campus’ business to such business entity. We will require any such successor
			business entity to honor the terms of this Privacy Policy.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Security</h3>

	<p>The security of your data is very important to Digital Campus. We have implemented
		appropriate security measures preventing your Personal Information from being accidentally
		lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. However, you should
		know that no web site operator, including Digital Campus, can fully eliminate security risks
		associated with Personal Information. While Digital Campus has endeavored to create a secure
		and reliable website for users, the confidentiality of any communication or material
		transmitted to/from the User or via e-mail cannot be guaranteed. We have put in place
		procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Information breach and will notify you and
		any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

	<h3>Children’s Privacy Protection</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Under Age 13: Digital Campus understands the importance of protecting children’s privacy
			in the interactive online world. The Online Services are not designed for, or
			intentionally targeted at, children under 13 years of age. It is not our policy to
			intentionally collect or maintain information about anyone under the age of 13. No one
			under the age of 13 should submit any Personal Information to Digital Campus or the
			Online Services.</li>
		<li>Under Age 18: Minors under 18 years of age may have the Personal Services deleted by
			sending an email to admin@digital-campus.org requesting deletion. Please note that,
			while we make reasonable efforts to comply with such requests, deletion of your personal
			information does not ensure complete and comprehensive removal of that data from all
			systems.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Response to “Do Not Track” Signals</h3>

	<p>Some Internet browsers include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” signals. Since uniform
		standards for “Do Not Track” signals have not yet been adopted, Digital Campus does not
		process or respond to “Do Not Track” signals.</p>

	<h3>Updating Your Information</h3>

	<p>If you wish to stop receiving emails or other communications from us, or if you have
		submitted Personal Information through our Online Services and would like that information
		deleted from our records, please notify us at
		<a href="mailto:admin@digital-campus.org">admin@digital-campus.org</a>.</p>

	<h3>Links to Third Party Websites</h3>

	<p>As a convenience to our Users the Online Services may contain links to other sites. The terms
		of usage and other conditions of use posted on those sites, and not the policies and
		procedures we described here, apply to those sites. Your linking to any other websites is
		at your own risk, and you are responsible for learning about and complying with the terms of
		usage and other conditions posted on those websites.</p>

	<h3>European Data Privacy Laws</h3>

	<p>If you reside or are located in the European Economic Area, you have certain rights in
		relation to your Personal Information under the applicable European data privacy laws under
		the General Data Protection Regulation and any other applicable data protection laws which
		may be amended from time to time (“European Data Privacy Laws”). This section only applies
		to such users.</p>
	<p>Under applicable European Data Privacy Laws, Digital Campus is the data controller. Under
		the applicable European Data Privacy Laws, you have the right to ensure your Personal
		Information is accurate. You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate
		Personal Information. You also have the right to request that we delete or restrict the
		processing of your Personal Information, although we are permitted to retain it where we
		still have an ongoing purpose to retain it or as otherwise permitted under the European
		Data Privacy Laws. This may compromise our ability to provide you with our services. You
		also have the right to transfer your personal information to another service provider
		subject to the European Data Privacy Laws. We will, following your written request to us,
		provide you with your relevant Personal Information in a machine-readable format to transfer
		to another service provider. We will aim to respond to your request within one calendar
		month of receipt of the request. Where we are unable to do so within the calendar month, we
		will notify you of our need to extend this timeline. There are certain exemptions and
		restrictions applicable to the exercise of these rights under the European Data Privacy Laws
		that enable personal information to be retained, processed or withheld from access and we
		will inform you of these, if applicable. To make any of these requests or to opt out of
		receiving marketing communications, please contact us at
		<a href="mailto:admin@digital-campus.org">admin@digital-campus.org</a></p>
	<p>You have the right to raise a complaint with a supervisory authority in your country of
		residence if applicable under European Data Privacy Laws.</p>

	<h3>Data Retention</h3>

	<p>We retain personal information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s)
		for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law. The criteria used to determine
		our retention periods include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to
			you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or continue to use the
			Services);</li>
		<li>Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws
			require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we
			can delete them); or</li>
		<li>Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (for example, in light of
			applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>International Transfers</h3>

	<p>Digital Campus is headquartered in Spain, a member of the European Economic Area (EEA). The
		information you provide to us or that we obtain as a result of your use of the Services is
		collected in your country and subsequently transferred to Spain or to another country in
		which our partners operate or in which we engage service providers.</p>

	<p>Some countries that are not members of the EEA are recognized by the European Commission as
		providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of
		these countries is available here). For transfers from the EEA to countries not considered
		adequate by the European Commission, we have put in place adequate measures, including by
		ensuring that the recipient is either Privacy Shield certified (for US-based providers), or
		bound by EU Standard Contractual Clauses, to protect your personal data. To obtain a copy of
		the EU Standard Contractual Clauses click here.

	<p>In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security
		authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your personal information.</p>

	<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>

	<p>This Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time as we add new features and services, as
		laws change, and as industry privacy and security best practices evolve. We display an effective
		date on the policy in the upper right corner of this Privacy Policy so that it will be easier
		for you to know when there has been a change. If we make any change to this Privacy Policy
		regarding use or disclosure of Personal Information, we will provide advance notice via the
		Online Services. Small changes or changes that do not significantly affect individual privacy
		interests may be made at any time and without prior notice.</p>

		or your dealings with the Online Services, please contact
