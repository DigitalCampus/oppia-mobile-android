<h1>Online Services Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>
	Your privacy is important to us. You can find our privacy policy below and online at:
		<a href="https://lastmilehealth.org/online-services-privacy-policy/">
			https://lastmilehealth.org/online-services-privacy-policy/</a>.
	</p>

<p>Effective Date: June 25, 2020</p>

<p>Last Mile Health, a non-profit corporation (“Last Mile Health,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is
	committed to protecting the privacy of users of the website located at www.lastmilehealth.org
	or any website or mobile application owned, operated, licensed or controlled by us (the “Online
	Services”). This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes how we gather and use
	information about visitors to and users of our Online Services (“Users”). This Privacy Policy
	applies solely to the information that we collect through the Online Services. This Privacy
	Policy does not address personal information that you provide to us in other contexts (e.g.,
	through a business relationship not handled through the Online Services).</p>

<h2>Acceptance of Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>By using the Online Services, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not
	agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Online Services. Your
	continued use of the Online Services following the posting of changes to these terms will
	mean that you accept those changes.</p>

<h2>How Do We Collect Your Information?</h2>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>You may use some of our Online Services without telling us anything about yourself. If you
	contact us, donate to us, or register for an account via the Online Services, we may ask you
	to provide Personal Information (as defined below), such as your name, address, telephone
	number or e-mail address. We may also receive Personal Information about you from third
	parties, such as our affiliates, business partners, or vendors who we engage to help administer
	the Online Services.</p>
<p>“Personal Information” for purposes of this Privacy Policy is any information relating to you as
	an identified or identifiable natural person. An “identifiable natural person” is one who can
	be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a
	name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors
	specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity
	of that natural person.</p>

<p>From time to time, our Online Services may be configured to collect domain, usage, and Google
	Analytics information. This data enables us to become more familiar with which users use our
	services, how often they visit and what parts of the services they utilize most often. Last
	Mile Health uses this information to improve our Online Services. No personally identifiable
	information is gathered in this process. This information is collected automatically and
	requires no action on your part.</p>

<h3>Other Information</h3>
<p>“Other Information” is any information that is not Personal Information, such as browser
	information, app usage data (including quiz attempts, scores and course completion),
	information collected through cookies and other technologies, demographic information, and
	aggregated information.</p>

<p>We collect Other Information when you submit it to us. It may include your zip code, education,
	occupation, and interests.</p>

<p>We may also receive Other Information about you from third-parties, including, for example,
	demographic data, information about your interests, and information about your activities
	through the Online Services. Each time a User utilizes the Online Services, Last Mile Health
	collects some information to improve the overall quality of the User’s online experience.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Aggregated Data: Last Mile Health collects aggregate queries for internal reporting and
		also counts, tracks, and aggregates the User’s activity (including quiz attempts, scores
		and course completion) into Last Mile Health’s analysis of general traffic flow to the
		Online Services and Users’ utilization of and performance within the Online Services.
		To these ends, Last Mile Health may merge information about you into aggregated group data.
		In some cases, Last Mile Health may remove personal identifiers from Personal Information
		and maintain it in aggregate form that may later be combined with other information to
		generate anonymous, aggregated statistical information. Such anonymous, group data may
		be shared on an aggregated basis with Last Mile Health’s affiliates, business partners,
		service providers and/or vendors; if it does so, Last Mile Health will not disclose your
		individual identity.</li>
	<li>Web Server Logs and IP Addresses: An Internet Protocol (“IP”) address is a number that
		automatically identifies the computer or device you have used to access the Internet. The
		IP address enables our server to send you the web pages that you want to visit, and it may
		disclose the server owned by your Internet Service Provider. Last Mile Health may use IP
		addresses to conduct analyses and performance reviews and to administer the Online
		Services.</li>
	<li>Cookies and Web Beacons: Periodically, some pages or screens on the Online Services may
		use “cookies,” which are small files that the site places on your hard drive for
		identification purposes. These files are used for site registration and customization the
		next time you visit us. You should note that cookies cannot read data off of your hard
		drive. Your web browser may allow you to be notified when you are receiving a cookie,
		giving you the choice to accept it or not. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them
		off in your browser. By not accepting cookies, some pages may not fully function and you
		may not be able to access certain information on the Online Services. Information that we
		collect through cookies includes (i) the name and version of the operating system on the
		User’s computer or mobile device, (ii) the name and version of the User’s browser, (iii)
		which aspects or pages of the Online Services the User is currently reading, as well as
		clicks and time spent on a particular page or screen, (iv) if the User was sent to the
		current page by some other page on the web, the universal resource locator (“URL”) of the
		referring web page, and (v) geolocation of the User’s computer or device. Some of the
		Site’s web pages may use web beacons in conjunction with cookies to compile aggregate
		statistics about Site usage. A web beacon is an electronic image (also referred to as an
		“action tag,” “single-pixel,” or “clear GIF”) that is commonly used to track the traffic
		patterns of users from one web page to another in order to maximize web traffic flow and
		to otherwise analyze the effectiveness of the User. Some web beacons may be unusable if
		you elect to reject their associated cookies.</li>
	<li>By accessing and using the Online Services, you expressly consent to the storage of cookies,
		other local storage technologies, beacons or other information on your computer or devices.
		You also consent to the access of such cookies, local storage technologies, beacons and
		information by us.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sensitive Personal Information</h3>
<p>Unless specifically requested (for example, in connection with a particular survey), we ask that
	you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal information (e.g., social
	security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion
	or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade
	union membership) on or through the Services or otherwise to us. Any requested information
	that includes sensitive information about health, political opinions, ethnicity, race,
	religion, sex life or sexual orientation can be left unanswered.</p>

<h2>How Do We Use Your Information?</h2>
<p>If you choose to provide us with Personal Information by completing a form through the Online
	Services, including, if applicable, account registration, or emailing us, we will use that
	Personal Information to (i) respond to your question or request, (ii) communicate with you
	about our organization via email, (iii) send information to you, and (iv) notify you of changes
	to this Privacy Policy. If you do not wish to receive unsolicited emails or other
	communications from us, you may contact us at info@lastmilehealth.org and request that your
	Personal Information be removed from our list.</p>

<p>We will only use your Personal Information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use
	your Personal Information in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Where you have requested information from Last Mile Health about its services.</li>
	<li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with
		you.</li>
	<li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your
		interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. “Legitimate interest”
		is a technical term under applicable regulations. It means that there are good reasons
		for the processing of your personal information and measures are taken to minimize the
		impact on your privacy rights and interests. “Legitimate interest” also references our
		use of your data in ways you would reasonably expect and that have a minimal privacy impact.
		We have a legitimate interest in collecting and processing personal information, for
		example: (1) to ensure that our networks and information are secure; (2) to administer
		and generally conduct business within Last Mile Health; and (3) to prevent fraud.</li>
	<li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that we may process your Personal Information for more than one lawful ground depending on
	the specific purpose for which we are using your data. Please note that we may use and disclose
	Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under
	applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under
	applicable law, then we may use and disclose it for all the purposes for which we use and
	disclose Personal Information. We may combine Other Information with your Personal Information,
	and when we do, we treat the combined information as Personal Information.</p>

<h2>Do We Disclose Any Personal Information to Outside Parties?</h2>
<p>Unless you expressly give us permission in writing to do so, Last Mile Health will not sell,
	rent, license, or trade your Personal Information other than as specified in this Privacy
	Policy.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Disclosures to Third Parties Assisting In Our Operations: Last Mile Health may share your
		Personal Information under confidentiality agreements with other companies that work with,
		or on behalf of, Last Mile Health to provide services. These companies may use your
		Personal Information to assist Last Mile Health in its operations and impact. However,
		these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.</li>
	<li>Disclosures Under Special Circumstances: We may provide information about you to respond to
		subpoenas, court orders, legal process or governmental regulations, or to establish or
		exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We believe it is necessary to
		share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal
		activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical
		safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law. In such circumstances, we will
		take appropriate measures to ensure that the requester understands the sensitive nature
		of the Personal Information that they may receive.</li>
	<li>Business Transfers: We may share your Personal Information with other business entities in
		connection with the sale, assignment, merger or other transfer of all or a portion of Last
		Mile Health’s business to such business entity. We will require any such successor business
		entity to honor the terms of this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>The security of your data is very important to Last Mile Health. We have implemented appropriate
	security measures preventing your Personal Information from being accidentally lost, used or
	accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. However, you should know that no web
	site operator, including Last Mile Health, can fully eliminate security risks associated with
	Personal Information. While Last Mile Health has endeavored to create a secure and reliable
	website for users, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to/from
	the User or via e-mail cannot be guaranteed. We have put in place procedures to deal with any
	suspected Personal Information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a
	breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy Protection</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Under Age 13: Last Mile Health understands the importance of protecting children’s privacy
		in the interactive online world. The Online Services are not designed for, or intentionally
		targeted at, children under 13 years of age. It is not our policy to intentionally collect
		or maintain information about anyone under the age of 13. No one under the age of 13 should
		submit any Personal Information to Last Mile Health or the Online Services.</li>
	<li>Under Age 18: Minors under 18 years of age may have the Personal Information that they have
		provided to Last Mile Health through the Online Services deleted by sending an email to
		info@lastmilehealth.org requesting deletion. Please note that, while we make reasonable
		efforts to comply with such requests, deletion of your personal information does not
		ensure complete and comprehensive removal of that data from all systems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Response to “Do Not Track” Signals</h2>
<p>Some Internet browsers include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” signals. Since uniform
	standards for “Do Not Track” signals have not yet been adopted, Last Mile Health does not
	process or respond to “Do Not Track” signals.</p>

<h2>Updating Your Information</h2>
<p>If you wish to stop receiving emails or other communications from us, or if you have submitted
	Personal Information through our Online Services and would like that information deleted from
	our records, please notify us at info@lastmilehealth.org.</p>

<h2>Links to Third Party Websites</h2>
<p>As a convenience to our Users the Online Services may contain links to other sites. The terms of
	usage and other conditions of use posted on those sites, and not the policies and procedures
	we described here, apply to those sites. Your linking to any other websites is at your own
	risk, and you are responsible for learning about and complying with the terms of usage and
	other conditions posted on those websites.</p>

<h2>European Data Privacy Laws</h2>
<p>If you reside or are located in the European Economic Area, you have certain rights in relation
	to your Personal Information under the applicable European data privacy laws under the General
	Data Protection Regulation and any other applicable data protection laws which may be amended
	from time to time (“European Data Privacy Laws”). This section only applies to such users.</p>

<p>Under applicable European Data Privacy Laws, Last Mile Health is the data controller. Under the
	applicable European Data Privacy Laws, you have the right to ensure your Personal Information
	is accurate. You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate Personal Information.
	You also have the right to request that we delete or restrict the processing of your Personal
	Information, although we are permitted to retain it where we still have an ongoing purpose to
	retain it or as otherwise permitted under the European Data Privacy Laws. This may compromise
	our ability to provide you with our services. You also have the right to transfer your personal
	information to another service provider subject to the European Data Privacy Laws. We will,
	following your written request to us, provide you with your relevant Personal Information in a
	machine-readable format to transfer to another service provider. We will aim to respond to your
	request within one calendar month of receipt of the request. Where we are unable to do so
	within the calendar month, we will notify you of our need to extend this timeline. There are
	certain exemptions and restrictions applicable to the exercise of these rights under the
	European Data Privacy Laws that enable personal information to be retained, processed or
	withheld from access and we will inform you of these, if applicable. To make any of these
	requests or to opt out of receiving marketing communications, please contact us at
	info@lastmilehealth.org</p>

<p>You have the right to raise a complaint with a supervisory authority in your country of
	residence if applicable under European Data Privacy Laws.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain personal information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for
	which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law. The criteria used to determine our
	retention periods include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you
		(for example, for as long as you have an account with us or continue to use the
		Services);</li>
	<li>Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws
		require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we
		can delete them); or</li>
	<li>Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (for example, in light of
		applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).</li>
</ul>

<h2>International Transfers</h2>
<p>Last Mile Health is headquartered in the United States. The information you provide to us or
	that we obtain as a result of your use of the Services is collected in your country and
	subsequently transferred to the United States or to another country in which we have facilities
	or our affiliates operate or in which we engage service providers.</p>

<p>Some countries that are not members of the European Economic Area (EEA) are recognized by the
	European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA
	standards (the full list of these countries is available here). For transfers from the EEA to
	countries not considered adequate by the European Commission, we have put in place adequate
	measures, including by ensuring that the recipient is either Privacy Shield certified (for
	US-based providers), or bound by EU Standard Contractual Clauses, to protect your personal
	data. To obtain a copy of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses

<p>In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security
	authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your personal information.</p>

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time as we add new features and services, as
	laws change, and as industry privacy and security best practices evolve. We display an
	effective date on the policy in the upper right corner of this Privacy Policy so that it will
	be easier for you to know when there has been a change. If we make any change to this Privacy
	Policy regarding use or disclosure of Personal Information, we will provide advance notice via
	the Online Services. Small changes or changes that do not significantly affect individual
	privacy interests may be made at any time and without prior notice.</p>

	your dealings with the Online Services, please contact info@lastmilehealth.org.</p>
