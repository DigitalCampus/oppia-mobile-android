<a id="faq1"></a><h3>Installing new courses</h3>
<p>To install a new course, from the homepage, press on the menu button and go to 'Manage courses'.
This will give you a list of the courses to select to download. you will need an active internet
connection to get the list of courses and to install them.</p>

<a id="faq2"></a><h3>Updating courses</h3>
<p>OppiaMobile will automatically alert you when there are new updates to your courses available and 
ready to download. You can also manually check for updates by visiting the manage courses page.</p>
<a href="#top" class="btn gotop">Top</a>

<a id="faq3"></a><h3>Installing/downloading media and videos</h3>
<p>When you download a new course, the course download will not include any media or video files. 
This is to ensure that the course is not too large to download easily, since the videos may be very large.
Instead, the media/video files should either be downloaded or copied to your phone SD card separately.
OppiaMobile will alert you if any required videos are missing, you can then select to download them. Due to 
their file size (and to avoid you using up too much of your mobile data connection) videos can only be downloaded 
when you are on a wifi connection. if you don't have a wifi connection, you can download the files directly to your PC,
and then copy them to the SD card form there, to do this, follow the instructions from the 'Download via PC' button 
to guide you through this.</p>

<a id="faq4"></a><h3>Playing media and videos</h3>
<p>When there are videos in your course, when you press to play on them, OppiaMobile will use your default or preferred 
video media player. If you receive a message that the video could not be played, it is likely that you haven't yet downloaded 
that video.</p>

<a id="faq5"></a><h3>What do the points mean?</h3>
<p>OppiaMobile awards you points for taking part in activities, watching videos and for your quiz scores. The more regularly you
take the activities, attempt quizzes and play the videos the more points you will earn.</p>

<a id="faq6"></a><h3>How are badges achieved?</h3>
<p>OppiaMobile awards you badges for completing courses. Badges are awarded on the server when specific criteria is met,
so <strong>you'll need an active internet connection</strong> for this funcionality to work. Currently, the server can be configured to give badges
based on one of this options:
<ul>
    <li>Only the final quiz needs to be completed and passed. </li>
    <li>All quizzes need to be completed and passed. </li>
    <li>All quizzes need to be completed and passed, and a percentage of all other activities completed. This percentage is configurable in the settings. </li>
    <li>All activities must be completed, including all quizzes passed and all media viewed. </li>
</ul>
You can see the current criteria on the main scorecard screen.
